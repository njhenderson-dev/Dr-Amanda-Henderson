# Dr Amanda Henderson — website

Modern, code-based website for **Dr Amanda Henderson**, a female family GP in
Maroubra, Sydney. Migrated from Squarespace with careful SEO preservation.

Positioning centres on women's health, pregnancy & pre-pregnancy care, shared
antenatal care, children's health, family medicine and preventative health.
Skin cancer checks and cosmetic procedures have been intentionally removed from
the practice's positioning.

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) · **React 19** · **TypeScript** — static generation, minimal client JS
- **Tailwind CSS** — warm editorial design system (no clinical blue)
- **MDX** articles (`content/articles/`) + typed content model (`lib/site.ts`)
- Structured data (schema.org JSON-LD) in `lib/schema.ts`

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build (fully static)
npm start        # serve the production build
```

## Where things live

| Area | Path |
|---|---|
| Practice details, nav, service pillars, copy | `lib/site.ts` |
| Structured data (Physician / MedicalClinic / Article / Breadcrumb / FAQ) | `lib/schema.ts` |
| Articles (editable, frontmatter + Markdown) | `content/articles/*.mdx` |
| Article loader | `lib/articles.ts` |
| Pages | `app/**/page.tsx` |
| 301 redirect map (Squarespace → new) | `next.config.mjs` |
| Sitemap / robots | `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts` |

## Editing content

- **Practice info, pillar copy, FAQs, credentials:** edit `lib/site.ts`.
- **Articles:** add/edit `content/articles/<slug>.mdx` (frontmatter: `title`,
  `description`, `category`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `draft`). Set
  `draft: true` to hide from the site and sitemap.
- **Booking / phone / address:** single source of truth in `lib/site.ts`.

## Before launch

See **`MIGRATION-PLAN.md` §15** and **`MIGRATION-QA.md`**. Key blockers:
real photography of Dr Henderson, migrating original images off the Squarespace
CDN, Search Console + analytics IDs, and confirmed opening hours.
